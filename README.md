* Develop Website to supplant the CLI app
* Build new CLI app that will talk to Web API
* Replace shell commands where possible with native python calls
* Add capability to run over DHCP (removes need for providing IP info)
* Flesh out admin.py to provide more functionality
* Add error checking to admin.py
